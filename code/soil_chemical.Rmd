# Characteristics of the starting soil    
Soil for the incubation was collected from organic alfalfa plots, surface cores were collected from all plots and composited into a bulk soil sample. Bulk soil was sieved to 2mm and allowed to air-dry before microcosm construction. 

```{r, meta data}
data <- readRDS("data/RDS/incubation_physeq_Aug18.RDS")
meta_data <- data.frame(sample_data(data))
```

The characteristics of the starting soil are as follows:
```{r}
meta_data %>%
  filter(treatment %in% c("AlfalfaSoil", "AlfalfaAmend","CompostAmend")) %>%
  mutate(Inorganic_N = NO3 + NH3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = Inorganic_N)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    scale_x_discrete(limits=c("AlfalfaAmend","CompostAmend", "AlfalfaSoil"))
```
